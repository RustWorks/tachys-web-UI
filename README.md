# tachys
This is an extremely experimental web UI library for Rust, exploring concepts of compile-time, trait-based, low-allocation patterns for UI templating.

The `View` trait pattern is taken from [Concoct](https://github.com/concoct-rs/concoct/) and [Xilem](https://github.com/linebender/xilem).

This is purely a playground for me to explore patterns that can be incorporated back into [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos).

Feel free to use it or explore or steal ideas, but **do not expect this to be a maintained library.**

> The name: ταχύς means “fast” or “swift,” which is both a) true (this is quite fast) and b) a bit of a pun, as the method of using statically-typed views is inspired by SwiftUI.
